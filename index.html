            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a software engineer based in Dublin, Ireland, working at
                Microsoft on AI-powered provisioning experiences for SharePoint.
                I focus on frontend and fullstack engineering with React,
                TypeScript, and Fluent UI, and I care about building reliable,
                well-tested experiences at enterprise scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work I build tools like the Irish Mortgage Calculator
                and Goals Bingo, plus browser extensions, editor plugins, and
                bespoke web apps for small businesses, friends, and family. I'm
                especially interested in using AI and thoughtful, accessible UX
                to make complex workflows easier for people.

                <summary>Irish Mortgage Calculator</summary>

                <p>
                    This is a simple <strong>mortgage calculator</strong> for
                    Ireland. It allows users to calculate their monthly mortgage
                    payments based on the <strong>loan amount</strong>,
                    <strong>interest rate</strong>, and
                    <strong>loan term</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Tech Stack</h4>

                <p>
                    It is built using <strong>React</strong>,
                    <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and
                    <strong>Fluent UI v9</strong>, and is hosted on
                    <strong>Azure Static Web Apps</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Motivation</h4>

                <p>
                    When my partner and I were looking to buy our first home, we
                    found it difficult to find a mortgage calculator that let us
                    compare the mortgage options across banks and for each house
                    we were looking at. The available calculators often were
                    more for finding a mortgage product rather than quickly
                    comparing monthly payments for different scenarios.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made this as a "bring your own terms" mortgage calculator
                    to help us quickly calculate and compare monthly payments
                    for the mortgage options we were already approved for.
                </p>

                <summary>Goals Bingo</summary>

                <p>
                    This is a simple <strong>bingo game</strong> for
                    <strong>New Year's Resolutions</strong>. It allows users to
                    create a bingo card with their goals and share it with
                    friends.
                </p>

                <h4>Tech Stack</h4>

                <p>
                    It is built using <strong>React</strong> and
                    <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and is hosted on
                    <strong>Vercel</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on both
                    desktop and mobile devices.
                </p>

                <h4>Motivation</h4>

                <p>
                    I originally built Goals Bingo for myself and my friends as
                    a different take on New Year's resolutions. Instead of a
                    simple pass/fail list written in one evening, we create a
                    bingo card filled with goals of varying difficulty. Over the
                    year we try to complete a row, column, or diagonal,
                    reflecting the idea that life isn't about hitting every goal
                    perfectly, but about continually improving and celebrating
                    the progress you do make.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made this app so it can be used offline as a PWA, so my
                    friends who were doing a lot of travel could still plan
                    their goals on a plane (and because I just wanted to learn
                    how to make a PWA!).
