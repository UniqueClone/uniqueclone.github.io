        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a frontend-focused software engineer based in Dublin, Ireland,
            currently working at Microsoft. I build complex React and TypeScript
            interfaces, lead accessibility transformations, and ship
            high-quality, test-driven UI features for large-scale products.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience spans state management, dynamic and schema-driven
            forms, and fullstack integrations with platforms like SharePoint and
            Supabase. I focus on building accessible, WCAG-aligned interfaces,
            with strong automated testing and developer tooling to keep large
            codebases reliable over time.

        <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Traitors Game (Next.js + Supabase)</summary>

            <p>
                A real-time multiplayer game tool for 10-20 players,
                handling voting, round progression, traitor actions, and win
                logic. Built with Next.js and Supabase and used multiple
                times with excellent feedback on the UI and usability.
            </p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>

            <p>
                I built this to make it easier to run social deduction
                games with friends without relying on pen-and-paper or
                ad-hoc tracking. The goal was a smooth, guided experience
                that keeps the focus on the people and the game, not on the
                mechanics.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Azure DevOps PR File Colors (Edge Extension)</summary>

            <p>
                A published Microsoft Edge extension that improves Azure
                Repos pull request review workflows by colour-coding
                truncated filenames, making it easier to scan large PRs.
                Available in the Edge Add-ons store.
            </p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                This started as a small quality-of-life fix for my own code
                reviews. Long file paths were constantly truncated in PRs,
                so I built an extension to make important files stand out
                visually and reduce cognitive overhead during reviews for my team.

                Cross-platform countdown timer desktop app packaged as a
                downloadable executable.

            </p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                I wanted a lightweight, offline-friendly way to track
                the time remaining until my next meeting, and to always
                have it visible on my desktop. This project also let me
                explore Tauri as an alternative to Electron for cross-platform desktop
                apps.

            <summary>Irish Mortgage Calculator</summary>

            <p>
                Custom <strong>mortgage calculator</strong> for Irish
                homebuyers, designed as a flexible "bring your own terms"
                tool. It lets users quickly compare monthly mortgage
                payments across different banks and scenarios using the loan
                amounts, interest rates, fees, and terms they already have.
            </p>

            <h4>Tech Stack</h4>

            <p>
                Built with <strong>React</strong>,
                <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and
                <strong>Fluent UI v9</strong>, and hosted on
                <strong>Azure Static Web Apps</strong>.
            </p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                When my partner and I were buying our first home, most
                online calculators were focused on product discovery rather
                than quickly comparing scenarios. I built this tool so we
                could quickly plug in the exact terms we were offered and compare
                monthly payments and how much savings we needed across multiple houses and banks.

            <summary>Goals Bingo</summary>

            <p>
                This is a simple <strong>bingo game</strong> for
                <strong>New Year's Resolutions</strong>. It allows users to
                create a bingo card with their goals and share it with
                friends.
            </p>

            <h4>Tech Stack</h4>

            <p>
                Built using <strong>React</strong> and
                <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and hosted on
                <strong>Vercel</strong>. It can be installed as a
                Progressive Web App (PWA) on both desktop and mobile
                devices.
            </p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                I originally built Goals Bingo for myself and my friends as
                a different take on New Year's resolutions. Instead of a
                simple pass/fail list written in one evening, we create a
                bingo card filled with goals of varying difficulty. Over the
                year we try to complete a row, column, or diagonal,
                reflecting the idea that life isn't about hitting every goal
                perfectly, but about continually improving and celebrating
                the progress you do make.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the app work offline as a PWA so friends who travel
                frequently can still plan and track goals without a
                connection.
